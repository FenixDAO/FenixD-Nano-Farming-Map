# FenixD Nano Farming Map
My edit of Saavicks to include new 3rd Layer that includes the following: Scottyboi Warp, Grid/FGrid, Whom-pah, Dynas. 

# Install
1. Download contents as zip
2. Place Folder (FenixNanoMap) at ...\Anarchy Online\cd_image\textures\PlanetMap
  Note: The final structure should be "\Anarchy Online\cd_image\textures\PlanetMap\FenixNanoMap" and this folder will contain (coords.xml and saavicks-fenix.txt and other related .bin files).
3. Select map named "FenixD Nano Map (Saavick's Edit)" in-game

# Usage
This is intended for farming nanos in missions and from Dyna camps.
The names listed on the map are the ones required by Scottyboi. For example, for ICC (on the map the code for this warp is "ICC"). So you would type /tell Scottyboi ICC.
